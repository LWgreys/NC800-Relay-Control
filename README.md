# NC800 Relay Control

Written in C#. Still learning the language of C#.

Work as far as turning ON & OFF relays, but still having problems in changing the IPaddress/Port which works the first time, but no so the next time.

A little more DEBUGGING needing.

I use the registery key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\NC800 to store the IP address & Port number. So if you RESET you NC800 relay control board, you will need to delete that registery item also.
Maybe I'll add in a auto delete key incase an unreachable IP/Port.
